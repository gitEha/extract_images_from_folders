# extract_images_from_folders
Extract images (or any type of file really) from different folders to one certain folder in a structured way.

In order to build a binary image classifier (cat vs not cat), I needed to sort my non-cat images from 101 different category folders to one certian folder in a structured way (noncat.IMAGENUMBER.jpg)
